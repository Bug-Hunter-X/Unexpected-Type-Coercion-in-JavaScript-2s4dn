# Unexpected Type Coercion in JavaScript

This example demonstrates a common error in JavaScript related to type coercion.  JavaScript's dynamic typing can lead to unexpected results when operating on values of different types.

The `bug.js` file contains code that adds a number and a string, resulting in unexpected string concatenation instead of numerical addition. The solution, shown in `bugSolution.js`, addresses the issue using explicit type checking or conversion to ensure the intended behavior.

This repository helps highlight the importance of careful type handling in JavaScript to avoid potential bugs and unexpected behavior in your applications.
